Final Project for the Web Design course I took at the Iron Yard in the fall of 2014

I redesigned the commercial banking side of TD Bank's website in order to display what I have learned which includes:
>
  1.  Responsive Web Design (this was a big deal in the course)
  2.  Web Typography through Adobe Typekit (this was a VERY big deal, especially for my intructor that correctly reminded me that 95% of Web Design is typography)
  3.  Color Theory (I had to stick to green of course because of the brand equity TD has invested in the color)
  4.  HTML and CSS3 
  5.  Sass as my CSS pre-processor
  6.  Github of course!
  7.  Photoshop and Illustrator (lots of work with that)

>AND the general designer workflow (research, sketches, wireframes, digital wireframes, style tiles, and coding)

And as my instructors pointed out at the Demo Day when I presented the project in front of the audience, I specifically pushed myself in a few areas beyond what was required:
>
  1. JavaScript (I wrote more JS than all of my classmates)
  2. Responsive User Experience (not the same as Responsive Web Design, but specifically a UX system that responds to user inputs and gives feedback throghout the banking process)
  3. System based programming (where the structure of the website architecture and the code it operates on is not a set of independent pages and objects, but rather a coherent system that changes based on the context of the user)
